                    <h3>Architecture Components</h3>
                    
                    <h4>1. Client Layer (User Interface)</h4>
                    <p>This is the interface through which users interact with the system. It is designed to be intuitive and responsive.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Web Browsers:</strong> Accessed via modern web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.</li>
                        <li><strong>Technology Stack:</strong> Built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+). May utilize a frontend framework/library like React, Angular, or Vue.js for a rich, single-page application (SPA) experience or a more traditional multi-page application (MPA) with server-side rendering.</li>
                        <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Ensures a seamless experience on desktops and tablets, adapting layout and functionality to different screen sizes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Local Storage/Cache:</strong> Browser capabilities might be used for caching static assets or temporarily storing non-sensitive application state to improve performance and user experience.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>2. Presentation Layer (Web/API Gateway)</h4>
                    <p>This layer handles incoming client requests, routing them to the appropriate application services, and managing static asset delivery. It acts as the entry point to the backend system.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Web Server (e.g., Nginx, Apache):</strong> Serves static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) and acts as a reverse proxy to the application servers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Load Balancer (If applicable for scaling):</strong> Distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of the application server to ensure high availability and performance. (As shown in the diagram).</li>
                        <li><strong>API Gateway:</strong> Manages API requests, potentially handling concerns like request/response transformation, rate limiting, and initial authentication/authorization steps before forwarding to the application layer.</li>
                        <li><strong>SSL/TLS Termination:</strong> Encrypts and decrypts HTTPS traffic, offloading this task from the application servers.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>3. Application Layer (Business Logic)</h4>
                    <p>The core of the system, containing all the business logic, processing, and coordination required to fulfill user requests and manage clinic operations.</p>
                    <ul>
